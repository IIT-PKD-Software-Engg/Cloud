this is just a sample code performing the following:

1) Sign-In and connect to Azure using the DefaultAzureCredential
2) Create Container
3) Upload blob(Hello World! containing text file) to a container
4) Lists all blobs in that container
5) Download the blob
6) Clean the entire thing i.e.
	a) Delete the blob container
	b) Delete the local source and downloaded files

Static objects - sent at one go

Dynamic allocation at the cloud within bounds
- what about big files? Compression of data
- streaming data? Compression on the go

Dividing the cloud based on users - which involves authentication

Is there requirement for the storage items or things which may be coming in the specific format....each team could send a different format of embedding or serialisation......For such cases will be required for every such file to idk like reconverted into some different format to maintain some like consistency while storage 

**Should we scale up the cloud as and when the sizeof the userbase grows?

* There can be some optimal storage methods for certain files formats, so we can look into those

** Plus we need to look into data loss while transferring as well

** Each team will send different data through the json file, but the format of the push-pull requests have to be the consistent for all

** Cloud transfer will be done async

** What to do when cloud is down?

Security for cloud details

Cloud stress testing
Multiple systems which will be pushing to the cloud

Distributed and gui demo

Content of the Cloud:
1. Image from whiteboard
2. Chat messages from Content

Integrate with dashboard to get user authentication

We divide the cloud based on each user
Each user has a dedicated folder
The folder has to be authenticated

The folder is subdivided by two folders:
1. Whiteboard Images
2. Content chats

login into cloud details required:
1. user details

after login - 
put request details required:
2. data
3. source of the data

get request details:
1. data_uri
2. source of the data

put request details:
1. old data_uri
2. new data
3. source of the data

delete request details:
1. data_uri
2. source of the data

how the meta data would be stored:
1. data_uri
2. data
3. timestamp
4. user
5. folder
